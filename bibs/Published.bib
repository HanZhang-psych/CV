How should we characterize individual differences in their distractibility? Two samples of adult participants (total N = 1220) completed a large battery of questionnaires assessing different facets of real-world distractibility. Latent modeling revealed that these measures could be explained by three correlated-yet-distinct factors: external distraction, unwanted intrusive thoughts, and mind-wandering. Importantly, about 80\% of the total variance in these three factors could be explained by a single higher-order factor (d) that could be construed in terms of a person’s general distractibility, and this general distractibility model was replicated across the two samples. We then applied the general distractibility model to understand the nature of {ADHD} symptomatology and hyperfocus (an intense state of long-lasting and highly focused attention). d was substantially associated with self-reported {ADHD} symptoms. Interestingly, d was also positively associated with hyperfocus, suggesting that hyperfocus may, to some degree, reflect attention problems. These results also show marked consistencies across the two samples.

	abstract = {During scene viewing, semantic information in the scene has been shown to play a dominant role in guiding fixations compared to visual salience (e.g., Henderson \& Hayes, 2017). However, scene viewing is sometimes disrupted by cognitive processes unrelated to the scene. For example, viewers sometimes engage in mind-wandering, or having thoughts unrelated to the current task. How do meaning and visual salience account for fixation allocation when the viewer is mind-wandering, and does it differ from when the viewer is on-task? We asked participants to study a series of real-world scenes in preparation for a later memory test. Thought probes occasionally occurred after a subset of scenes to assess whether participants were on-task or mind-wandering. We used salience maps (Graph-Based Visual Saliency; Harel, Koch, \& Perona, 2007) and meaning maps (Henderson \& Hayes, 2017) to represent the distribution of visual salience and semantic richness in the scene, respectively. Because visual salience and meaning were represented similarly, we could directly compare how well they predicted fixation allocation. Our results indicate that fixations prioritized meaningful over visually salient regions in the scene during mind-wandering just as during attentive viewing. These results held across the entire viewing time. A re-analysis of an independent study (Krasich, Huffman, Faber, \& Brockmole Journal of Vision, 20(9), 10, 2020) showed similar results. Therefore, viewers appear to prioritize meaningful regions over visually salient regions in real-world scenes even during mind-wandering.},

Eye movements naturally unfold over time and this process may reveal novel information about cognitive processing during {MW}. The current study used Recurrence Quantification Analysis (Anderson, Bischof, Laidlaw, Risko, \& Kingstone, 2013) to describe the pattern of refixations (fixations directed to previously inspected regions) during {MW}. Participants completed a real-world scene encoding task and responded to thought probes assessing intentional and unintentional {MW}. Both types of {MW} were associated with worse memory of the scenes. More important, {RQA} showed that scanpaths during unintentional {MW} were more repetitive than during on-task episodes, as indicated by a higher recurrence rate and more stereotypical fixation sequences. This increased repetitiveness suggests an adaptive response to processing failures through reexamining previous locations. Moreover, this increased repetitiveness contributed to fixations focusing on a smaller spatial scale of the stimuli. Finally, we were also able to validate several traditional measures: both intentional and unintentional {MW} were associated with fewer and longer fixations; eye-blinking increased numerically during both types of {MW} but the difference was only significant for unintentional {MW}. Overall, the results advanced our understanding of how visual processing is affected during {MW} by highlighting the sequential aspect of eye movements.

	abstract = {The study of attentional allocation due to external stimulation has a long history in psychology. Since the early work by Yantis and Jonides, there has been a growing and consistent interest in the effect of abrupt visual onsets on such attentional allocation. Yantis and Jonides concluded that abrupt onsets constitute a possibly unique class of stimuli that captures attention in a stimulus-driven fashion, unless attention is proactively directed elsewhere. Since then, the field of visual search has evolved significantly. This article revisits the core conclusions by Yantis and Jonides in light of subsequent evidence and highlights emerging issues for future investigation. We argue that perhaps due to their strong potential to capture attention, abrupt onsets are often set aside as a special case in pursuit of conditions that show attenuation of capture by other types of distractors, such as color singletons. However, given their prevalence in real life, abrupt onsets represent the exact type of stimuli that we need to study more to understand the mechanisms of attentional guidance, including whether abrupt onsets can be suppressed. We also propose using methods that more precisely measure the temporal and spatial dynamics of visual attention beyond making binary judgments about whether attention is captured or not. We provide an example, the forced-response method, that might be suitable for this endeavor.},

	abstract = {Humans tend to slow down after making an error. A longstanding account of this post-error slowing is that people are simply more cautious. However, accuracy typically does not improve following an error, leading some researchers to suggest that an initial ‘orienting’ response may initially impair performance immediately following error. Unfortunately, characterizing the nature of this error-based impairment remains a challenge in standard tasks that use free response times. By exerting control over the timing of responses, we reveal the time course of stimulus-response processing. Participants are less accurate after an error even when given ample time to make a response. A computational model of response preparation rules out the possibility that errors lead to slower cognitive processing. Instead, we find that the efficacy of cognitive processing in producing an intended response is impaired following errors. Following an error, participants commit more slips of action that tend to be a repetition of the previous mistake. Rather than a strategic shift along a single speed-accuracy tradeoff function, post-error slowing observed in free response time tasks may be an adaptive response to impaired cognitive processing that reflects an altered relationship between the speed and accuracy of responses. People tend to be more cautious and slow down their responses after making a mistake. Paradoxically, this doesn’t always lead to performance improvement. Here, the authors show that, even when given ample time, people are still more error-prone after they have already committed an error.},

In a feature-search task, participants searched for a constant shape among different shapes while ignoring a uniquely coloured distractor. Trial-by-trial fluctuations in attentional resources were assessed via thought probes that elicited mind-wandering reports and via pre-trial pupil sizes. The results show that initial eye movements to the distractor were suppressed regardless of the availability of attentional resources. However, when mind-wandering, the presence of the distractor prolonged target looking time. Thus, the initial deployment of overt attention in this task does not require attentional resources and can proceed automatically, presumably due to strong selection history. Nonetheless, the distractor might still disrupt later processing stages, an effect exacerbated by mind-wandering. These results also suggest that initial eye movements do not fully reflect the extent of distractor interference during the entire course of visual search.},

The method involves fixing the overall response time, varying the onset of stimuli, and observing response expression. We applied this method to an arrow flanker task. By systematically varying the time between stimulus onset and response, we reveal a comprehensive time course of the flanker interference effect that is rarely observed in previous literature. We further show that influential manipulations observed in free-{RT} paradigms similarly affect accuracy within the forced-response technique, suggesting that the forced-response method retains the core cognitive processing characteristics of traditional free-{RT} conflict tasks. As a behavioral method that examines the time course of cognitive processing, the forced-response method provides a novel and more nuanced look into the dynamics of conflict resolution.},

What gives abrupt onsets such a powerful ability to capture our attention? One common assumption is that they are highly salient. We quantiﬁed the level of physical salience of abrupt onsets and found that they were, in fact, less salient compared to color singletons (a uniquely colored item). Despite this, abrupt onsets captured attention in a visual search task when they served as distractors, whereas color singleton distractors did not. Therefore, abrupt onsets indeed strongly capture attention, but this is not necessarily because they are physically salient.

	abstract = {Prior research suggests that people often misunderstand visualizations of inflow (e.g., deposits in a banking context) and accumulation (e.g., cumulative savings) in dynamic systems. The present study aimed to examine participants’ understanding of accumulation functions and to develop and test the effectiveness of video-based interventions for improving understanding of accumulation. In Experiment 1, we tested the effectiveness of an intervention seated in the context of understanding {COVID}-19 data. In Experiment 2, we addressed several limitations of Experiment 1 and developed an improved, more general intervention to teach about accumulation in contexts outside of epidemiological data. The two randomized control experiments demonstrated that people fail to understand even simple systems with a single inflow that accumulates over time, with 44\%–60\% of participants earning a 0\% on our pretest measure. However, we also demonstrated that video-based interventions illustrating the relationship between multiple representations of the same underlying data are an effective way to improve the understanding of the relationship between inflow and accumulation, with Experiment 1 suggesting that the effects of our intervention lasted up to 6–7 weeks after testing.
