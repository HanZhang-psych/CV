	abstract = {We present {PupEyes}, an open-source Python package for preprocessing and visualizing pupil size and eye movement data. Developed with current best practices in mind, {PupEyes} offers a comprehensive and reproducible pupil preprocessing pipeline, as well as interactive visualizations to facilitate data exploration and outlier detection. In addition to pupil size data, {PupEyes} supports interactive visualization of eye movement data, including scanpath animations, fixation density plots, and area-of-interest ({AOI}) maps. It also provides tools for manually drawing {AOIs}, assigning fixations to {AOIs}, and computing basic {AOI}-based metrics. Cleaned data are returned as pandas data frames, making them compatible with other data analysis and visualization packages within the Python ecosystem. {PupEyes} also features an intuitive Application Programming Interface ({API}) and detailed online tutorials (https://pupeyes.readthedocs.io/), making it accessible to users with varying levels of programming experience. Overall, {PupEyes} (1) ensures that pupil size data are preprocessed in a principled, transparent, and reproducible manner, (2) helps researchers better understand their data through interactive visualizations, and (3) enables flexible extensions for further analysis tailored to specific research goals. We believe {PupEyes} is a useful addition to the analysis workflow for pupil size and eye movement data.},
