	abstract = {On April 13, 2021, the {CDC} announced that the administration of Johnson and Johnson’s {COVID}-19 vaccine would be paused due to a rare blood clotting side effect in {\textasciitilde} 0.0001\% of people given the vaccine. Most people who are hesitant to get a {COVID}-19 vaccine list potential side effects as their main concern ({PEW}, 2021); thus, it is likely that this announcement increased vaccine hesitancy among the American public. Two days after the {CDC}’s announcement, we administered a survey to a group of 2,046 Americans to assess their changes in attitudes toward {COVID}19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to investigate whether viewing icon arrays of side effect risk would prevent increases in {COVID}-19 vaccine hesitancy due to the announcement. We found that using icon arrays to illustrate the small chance of experiencing the blood clotting side effect significantly prevented increases in aversion toward the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as well as all other {COVID}-19 vaccines.},

	shorttitle = {Abrupt Onsets in Visual Search},
	abstract = {The study of attentional allocation due to external stimulation has a long history in psychology. Since the early work by Yantis and Jonides, there has been a growing and consistent interest in the effect of abrupt visual onsets on such attentional allocation. Yantis and Jonides concluded that abrupt onsets constitute a possibly unique class of stimuli that captures attention in a stimulus-driven fashion, unless attention is proactively directed elsewhere. Since then, the field of visual search has evolved significantly. This article revisits the core conclusions by Yantis and Jonides in light of subsequent evidence and highlights emerging issues for future investigation. We argue that perhaps due to their strong potential to capture attention, abrupt onsets are often set aside as a special case in pursuit of conditions that show attenuation of capture by other types of distractors, such as color singletons. However, given their prevalence in real life, abrupt onsets represent the exact type of stimuli that we need to study more to understand the mechanisms of attentional guidance, including whether abrupt onsets can be suppressed. We also propose using methods that more precisely measure the temporal and spatial dynamics of visual attention beyond making binary judgments about whether attention is captured or not. We provide an example, the forced-response method, that might be suitable for this endeavor.},
