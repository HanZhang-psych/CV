	abstract = {During scene viewing, semantic information in the scene has been shown to play a dominant role in guiding fixations compared to visual salience (e.g., Henderson \& Hayes, 2017). However, scene viewing is sometimes disrupted by cognitive processes unrelated to the scene. For example, viewers sometimes engage in mind-wandering, or having thoughts unrelated to the current task. How do meaning and visual salience account for fixation allocation when the viewer is mind-wandering, and does it differ from when the viewer is on-task? We asked participants to study a series of real-world scenes in preparation for a later memory test. Thought probes occasionally occurred after a subset of scenes to assess whether participants were on-task or mind-wandering. We used salience maps (Graph-Based Visual Saliency; Harel, Koch, \& Perona, 2007) and meaning maps (Henderson \& Hayes, 2017) to represent the distribution of visual salience and semantic richness in the scene, respectively. Because visual salience and meaning were represented similarly, we could directly compare how well they predicted fixation allocation. Our results indicate that fixations prioritized meaningful over visually salient regions in the scene during mind-wandering just as during attentive viewing. These results held across the entire viewing time. A re-analysis of an independent study (Krasich, Huffman, Faber, \& Brockmole Journal of Vision, 20(9), 10, 2020) showed similar results. Therefore, viewers appear to prioritize meaningful regions over visually salient regions in real-world scenes even during mind-wandering.},

We consider whether attentional capture is modulated by trial-by-trial ﬂuctuations of attentional state and experiences on the previous trial. We also consider whether individual diﬀerences may aﬀect attentional capture while highlighting potential challenges in using the colour-singleton task to measure individual diﬀerences. Finally, performance in the colour-singleton task can be modiﬁed dramatically with practice but the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Understanding the malleability of attentional capture may broaden the current framework and resolve outstanding questions.},

	abstract = {{IntroductionAdults} with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ({ADHD}) are generally distractible. Yet, the precise relationship between {ADHD} and distractibility remains under-specified in two respects. First, different sources of distraction, such as background noise or mind wandering, may not be equally associated with {ADHD}. Second, {ADHD} itself comprises a variety of symptoms that show considerable heterogeneity and it is unclear which {ADHD} symptoms are associated with which type of distraction.{MethodsThe} current study addresses these questions using one clinically evaluated sample (N = 69) and two large non-clinically evaluated samples (N = 569, N = 651). In all samples, participants completed questionnaires about their susceptibility to external distraction, unwanted intrusive thoughts, spontaneous mind-wandering and {ADHD} symptomatology.{ResultsTraditional} regression and novel network analyses revealed an overwhelming contribution of spontaneous mind-wandering in explaining {ADHD} symptoms, although external distraction and unwanted intrusive thoughts were also associated with a small number of {ADHD} symptoms.{DiscussionFindings} support a growing body of literature linking spontaneous mind-wandering and {ADHD}, and they highlight the heterogeneity in the association between {ADHD} symptoms and different sources of distraction.},

Most people who are hesitant to get a {COVID}-19 vaccine list potential side effects as their main concern ({PEW}, 2021); thus, it is likely that this announcement increased vaccine hesitancy among the American public. Two days after the {CDC}’s announcement, we administered a survey to a group of 2,046 Americans to assess their changes in attitudes toward {COVID}19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to investigate whether viewing icon arrays of side effect risk would prevent increases in {COVID}-19 vaccine hesitancy due to the announcement. We found that using icon arrays to illustrate the small chance of experiencing the blood clotting side effect significantly prevented increases in aversion toward the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as well as all other {COVID}-19 vaccines.},
