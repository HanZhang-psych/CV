We consider whether attentional capture is modulated by trial-by-trial ﬂuctuations of attentional state and experiences on the previous trial. We also consider whether individual diﬀerences may aﬀect attentional capture while highlighting potential challenges in using the colour-singleton task to measure individual diﬀerences. Finally, performance in the colour-singleton task can be modiﬁed dramatically with practice but the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Understanding the malleability of attentional capture may broaden the current framework and resolve outstanding questions.},

Most people who are hesitant to get a {COVID}-19 vaccine list potential side effects as their main concern ({PEW}, 2021); thus, it is likely that this announcement increased vaccine hesitancy among the American public. Two days after the {CDC}’s announcement, we administered a survey to a group of 2,046 Americans to assess their changes in attitudes toward {COVID}19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to investigate whether viewing icon arrays of side effect risk would prevent increases in {COVID}-19 vaccine hesitancy due to the announcement. We found that using icon arrays to illustrate the small chance of experiencing the blood clotting side effect significantly prevented increases in aversion toward the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as well as all other {COVID}-19 vaccines.},

	abstract = {People differ substantially in their vulnerability to distraction. Yet, many types of distractions exist, from external stimulation to internal thoughts. How should we characterize individual differences in their distractibility? Two samples of adult participants (total N = 1220) completed a large battery of questionnaires assessing different facets of real-world distractibility. Latent modeling revealed that these measures could be explained by three correlated-yet-distinct factors: external distraction, unwanted intrusive thoughts, and mind-wandering. Importantly, about 80\% of the total variance in these three factors could be explained by a single higher-order factor (d) that could be construed in terms of a person’s general distractibility, and this general distractibility model was replicated across the two samples. We then applied the general distractibility model to understand the nature of {ADHD} symptomatology and hyperfocus (an intense state of long-lasting and highly focused attention). d was substantially associated with self-reported {ADHD} symptoms. Interestingly, d was also positively associated with hyperfocus, suggesting that hyperfocus may, to some degree, reflect attention problems. These results also show marked consistencies across the two samples. Overall, the study provides an important step toward a comprehensive understanding of individual differences in distractibility and related constructs.},

	issn = {1943-393X},
	abstract = {During scene viewing, semantic information in the scene has been shown to play a dominant role in guiding fixations compared to visual salience (e.g., Henderson \& Hayes, 2017). However, scene viewing is sometimes disrupted by cognitive processes unrelated to the scene. For example, viewers sometimes engage in mind-wandering, or having thoughts unrelated to the current task. How do meaning and visual salience account for fixation allocation when the viewer is mind-wandering, and does it differ from when the viewer is on-task? We asked participants to study a series of real-world scenes in preparation for a later memory test. Thought probes occasionally occurred after a subset of scenes to assess whether participants were on-task or mind-wandering. We used salience maps (Graph-Based Visual Saliency; Harel, Koch, \& Perona, 2007) and meaning maps (Henderson \& Hayes, 2017) to represent the distribution of visual salience and semantic richness in the scene, respectively. Because visual salience and meaning were represented similarly, we could directly compare how well they predicted fixation allocation. Our results indicate that fixations prioritized meaningful over visually salient regions in the scene during mind-wandering just as during attentive viewing. These results held across the entire viewing time. A re-analysis of an independent study (Krasich, Huffman, Faber, \& Brockmole Journal of Vision, 20(9), 10, 2020) showed similar results. Therefore, viewers appear to prioritize meaningful regions over visually salient regions in real-world scenes even during mind-wandering.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that mind-wandering ({MW}) is associated with changes in eye movement parameters, but have not explored how {MW} affects the sequential pattern of eye movements involved in making sense of complex visual information. Eye movements naturally unfold over time and this process may reveal novel information about cognitive processing during {MW}. The current study used Recurrence Quantification Analysis (Anderson, Bischof, Laidlaw, Risko, \& Kingstone, 2013) to describe the pattern of refixations (fixations directed to previously inspected regions) during {MW}. Participants completed a real-world scene encoding task and responded to thought probes assessing intentional and unintentional {MW}. Both types of {MW} were associated with worse memory of the scenes. More important, {RQA} showed that scanpaths during unintentional {MW} were more repetitive than during on-task episodes, as indicated by a higher recurrence rate and more stereotypical fixation sequences. This increased repetitiveness suggests an adaptive response to processing failures through reexamining previous locations. Moreover, this increased repetitiveness contributed to fixations focusing on a smaller spatial scale of the stimuli. Finally, we were also able to validate several traditional measures: both intentional and unintentional {MW} were associated with fewer and longer fixations; eye-blinking increased numerically during both types of {MW} but the difference was only significant for unintentional {MW}. Overall, the results advanced our understanding of how visual processing is affected during {MW} by highlighting the sequential aspect of eye movements.
